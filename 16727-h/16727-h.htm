<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>"What we have got to do," says Lord <font
  class="sc">Rothermere</font>, "is to keep calm and mind our own business,
  instead of worrying about the affairs of every other nation." It seems
  only fair to point out that <i>The Daily News</i> thought of this as long
  ago as August, 1914.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Gooseberries the size of bantams' eggs, says a news item, won a prize
  at the Deeside Horticultural Show. When we remember the giant
  gooseberries of a decade ago it rather looks as if the nation were losing
  its nerve.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>With reference to the messenger seen running in Whitehall the other
  day a satisfactory explanation has now been given. He was doing it for
  the cinema.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The average Scot, says an Anti-Prohibition writer, cannot stand many
  drinks. Our experience supports this view; but he can be stood a good
  many.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A picture-paper gossip states that Mr. <font
  class="sc">Churchill</font> enjoys very good health. Just a touch of
  writer's cramp now and then, of course.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In a recent riot in Londonderry, it is stated, a number of inoffensive
  neutrals were set upon and beaten by rowdies of both factions. We have
  constantly maintained that Irish unity can always be secured when there
  is something really worth uniting over.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A lighthouse is advertised for sale in <i>The Times</i>. It is said to
  be just the kind of residence for a tall man with sloping shoulders.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A correspondent asks in the weekly press for a new name for
  charabancs. We wish we could think there was any use in calling them
  names.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Seaside bathers are advised not to enter the water after a heavy meal.
  The seaside visitor who could pay for such a meal would naturally not
  have enough left to pay for a bathing-machine.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Thames bargee was knocked down by a taxi-cab at Kingston-on-Thames
  last week. A well-known firm has offered to publish his remarks in
  fortnightly parts.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The West Dulwich man who struck a rate-collector on the head with a
  telephone claims credit for finding some use for these instruments.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Sir <font class="sc">Eric Drummond</font> has purchased the largest
  hotel in Geneva on behalf of the League of Nations. It is said that he
  has been taking lessons from Sir <font class="sc">Alfred Mond</font>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Following closely upon the announcement of the noiseless gun invented
  in New York comes the news that they have now invented some sound-proof
  bacon for export to this country.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is stated that the man who last week said he understood the Rent
  Act was eventually pinned down by some friends and handed over to the
  care of his relatives.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>According to a morning paper another Antarctic expedition is to be
  organised very shortly. We understand that only those who can stand a
  northern wind on all four sides need apply.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is reported that a poultry-farmer in the West of England is making
  a fortune by giving his hens whisky to drink and then exporting their
  eggs to the United States.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A golf-ball was recently driven through the window of an express train
  near Knebworth. We are informed however that the player who struck the
  ball still maintains that the engine-driver deliberately ignored his
  shout of "Fore."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>An amazing report reaches us from Yorkshire. It appears that a
  centenarian has been discovered who is unable to read without glasses or
  even to walk to market once a week.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The unveiling of one of the largest Peace memorials in the country is
  to take place on Armistice day this year. We hear that both the <font
  class="sc">Premier</font> and Mr. <font class="sc">Winston
  Churchill</font> have expressed a desire to attend unless prevented by
  the War.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Smart furriers, declares a fashion-paper, are pushing Beveren blue
  rabbit as one of the chic furs for the coming winter. The rabbit, our
  contemporary goes on to explain (superfluously, as it seems to us), is
  naturally blue.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>On a recent occasion a meeting of the Dolgelly Rural Council had to be
  postponed, the members being absent hay-making. Parliament, on the other
  hand, has had to stop making hay owing to the Members being away in the
  country.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Ministry of Food states that the period of normal supplies seems
  to come round in cycles of four years. Meanwhile the period of abnormal
  prices continues to come round in cycles of once a week. A movement in
  favour of postponing the cycle of payment till we get the cycle of plenty
  is not receiving adequate support from the provision trade.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Agricultural labourers near Peterborough have refused to work with
  Irishmen on the ground that the latter are troublesome. We always said
  that sooner or later someone would come round to Mr. <font
  class="sc">Lloyd George's</font> view on this point.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A newspaper reports the case of a waiter who refused a tip. It is said
  that the gentleman who offered it is making a slow recovery and may be
  able to take a little fish this week.</p>

<h2>IF WE ALL TOOK TO MARGOTRY.</h2>

  <p>[Mrs. <font class="sc">Asquith's</font> feuilleton, which for so many
  people has transformed Sunday into a day of unrest, sets up a new method
  of autobiography, in which the protagonist is, so to speak, both <font
  class="sc">Johnson</font> and <font class="sc">Boswell</font> too.
  Successful models being always imitated we may expect to see a general
  use of her lively methods; and as a matter of fact I have been able
  already, through the use of a patent futurist reading-glass (invented by
  Signer Margoni), to get glimpses of two forthcoming reminiscent works of
  the future which, but for the <i>chronique égoïstique</i> of the moment
  might never have been written, and certainly not in their present
  interlocutory shape.]</p>

<p class="center">I.</p>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">From "First Aid to Literature."</font></p>

<p class="center">By <i>Edmund Gosse</i>.</p>

  <p>... Not the least interesting and delicate of my duties as a
  confidential adviser were connected with a work of reminiscences which
  created some stir in the nineteen-twenties. How it came about I cannot
  recollect, but it was thought that my poor assistance as a friendly
  censor of a too florid exuberance in candour might not be of disservice
  to the book, and I accepted the invitation. The volume being by no means
  yet relegated to oblivion's dusty shelves I am naturally reluctant to
  refer to it with such particularity as might enable my argus-eyed reader
  to identify it and my own unworthy share therein, and therefore in the
  following dialogue, typical of many between the author and myself, I
  disguise her name under an initial. <i>Quis custodiet?</i> It would be
  grotesque indeed if one whose special mission was to correct the high
  spirits of others should himself fail in good taste.</p>

  <p><i>Mrs. A. (laying down the MS. with a bang).</i> I see nothing but
  blue pencil marks, and blue was never my colour. Why are you so anxious
  that I should be discreet? Indiscretion is the better part of
  authorship.</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Edmund</font> (earnestly).</i> It is your fame of
  which I am thinking. If you adopt my emendations you will go down to
  history as the writer of the best book of reminiscences in English.</p>

  <p><i>Mrs. A. (with fervour).</i> I don't want to go down to history. I
  want to stay here and make it. And you (<i>with emotion</i>)&mdash;you
  have cramped my style. I can't think why I asked you to help.</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Edmund</font>.</i> Everyone asks me to help. It is
  my destiny. I am the Muses' <i>amicus curiæ</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Mrs. A.</i> Oh, blow Latin! (<i>Lighting two cigarettes at
  once</i>) What's the good of reminiscences of to-day, by me, without
  anything about L.G.?</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Edmund</font>.</i> Dear lady, it would never have
  done. Be reasonable. There are occasions when reticence is
  imperative.</p>

  <p><i>Mrs. A.</i> Reticence! What words you use!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Cætera desunt.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">II.</p>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">From "A Week in Lovely Lucerne."</font></p>

<p class="center">By <i>D. Lloyd George</i>.</p>

  <p>... I do not say that the mountains hereabout are not more
  considerable than those of our own beloved Wales, but as material to be
  employed in perorations they are far inferior. There is not the requisite
  mist (which may symbolise ignorance or obstinacy or any temporary
  disturbance or opposition), later to be dispelled by the strong beams of
  the sun (representing either progress generally or prime-ministerial
  genius or pure Coalitionism). Other local features I felt, however, I
  might find rhetorically useful, such as <font
  class="sc">Thorwaldsen's</font> Lion, so noble, so&mdash;so leonine, but
  doomed ever to adhere to the rock, how symbolic of a strong idealist
  unable to translate his ameliorative plans into action! The old bridge
  too, uniting the two sides of the city, as one can attempt to link
  Radicalism and Coalitionism&mdash;how long could it endure? And so on.
  One's brain was never idle.</p>

  <p>It was while we were at Lucerne that <font class="sc">Lord
  Riddell</font> and I had some of our most significant conversations. I
  set them down just as they occurred, extenuating nothing and concealing
  nothing.</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Lord Riddell</font> (with emotion).</i> You are in
  excellent form to-day. Lucerne now has two lions&mdash;one of them
  free.</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">David</font> (surprised).</i> I free?
  (<i>Sadly</i>) You forget that <font class="sc">Giolitti</font> is
  coming.</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Lord Riddell</font>.</i> But that is nothing to
  you. Try him with your Italian and he will soon go.</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">David</font>.</i> You are a true friend. You
  always hearten me.</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Lord Riddell</font> (with more emotion).</i> But
  you are so wonderful, so wonderful! And now for to-day's amusements.
  Where shall we go? Up Mount Pilatus or to <font class="sc">William
  Tell's</font> Chapel?</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">David</font>.</i> There is something irresistible
  to a Welshman in the word chapel. Let us go there. And <font
  class="sc">William Tell</font>, was he not a patriot? Did he not defy the
  tyrant? I am sure that in his modest conventicle I can think of a
  thousand eloquent things. Let us go there.</p>

  <p><i><font class="sc">Lord Riddell</font>.</i> My hero! my dauntless
  hero!</p>

<h2>THE RABBITS GAME.</h2>

  <p>"Don't forget to say 'Rabbits' to-morrow," said Angela. Angela is aged
  nine and my younger sister; I am thirteen and my name is Anne.</p>

  <p>We both looked inquiringly at Father, and, as he didn't seem to
  remember, Angela in pained surprise began to explain. "If you say
  'Rabbits' before you say anything else on the first day of a month you
  get a present during the month, but you mustn't say anything else first,
  or you won't."</p>

  <p>It all came out in one breath and, though it looks clear enough now,
  Father was very stupid.</p>

  <p>"I dislike rabbits," he said, "and I am very busy; your Mother will
  probably be glad of them for the servants."</p>

  <p>The rebuke in Angela's eyes was severe. "We haven't got any rabbits,"
  she said; "we are only going to say 'Rabbits' to-morrow morning when we
  wake up and we thought you might like to do the same."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I should," said Father; "thank you very much, I won't forget."
  And he wrote "Rabbits" down on his blotting-paper. "Now go and tell your
  Mother; she would like to say 'Rabbits' too, I know."</p>

  <p>That seemed to terminate the interview, so we left him; but altogether
  it was not very satisfactory. You see, when we had
  "Bon-jour-Philippines," Father used to provide the presents; at least
  that was some time ago; we haven't had any "Bon-jour-Philippines" lately.
  The last time we did, Jack, that is my brother at Oxford, found one and
  split it with Father, and the next morning he said, "Bon-jour-Philippine"
  first and then asked for a present. Father asked him what he wanted, and
  he gave Father a letter that he had had that morning. Father got very
  angry and said that it was a disgrace the way tailors allowed credit to
  young wasters nowadays. He didn't say it quite like that, it was rather
  worse, and Mother said, "Hush, dear; remember the children," and Father
  said that they were all as bad and in the conspiracy to ruin him, and he
  went out of the room and banged the door.</p>

  <p>Mother told Jack that he should have chosen a better moment, and Jack
  owned he had made a mistake and said that he ought to have got it in
  before Father had looked at the paper and seen the latest news of <font
  class="sc">Lloyd George</font>. I don't quite know what he meant, but
  Father often talks about <font class="sc">Lloyd George</font>, and he
  must be a beast.</p>

  <p>I asked Jack later if he got his present, and he said that he had,
  but&mdash;and here he copied Father's voice so well that I had to
  laugh&mdash;"It is the very last time, my boy; when I was at Oxford I
  used to consider my Father, and I would have worked in the fields and
  earned money sooner than have given him bills to pay." Jack said that he
  knew one of the dons at Oxford who knew Father, and from what he said he
  thought that Father must have spent as long in the fields as <font
  class="sc">Nebuchadnezzar</font> did.</p>

  <p>I remembered all this as I went to find mother about "Rabbits," and I
  wasn't quite sure that we should get our present even if we did say it,
  so I told Angela, and she had a brilliant idea. "We will make Father say
  'Rabbits' and give him a present ourselves, and he is sure to give us
  something <span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg
  145]</span> in return." Angela is younger than I am, but she often thinks
  quite clever things like that, and they come in very useful
  sometimes.</p>

  <p>We went to the summer-house in the garden to make plans. First we
  thought what would be the best present to give Father. Last Christmas we
  gave him a pipe, and he said that it was just what he wanted; it cost
  ninepence and was made like a man's head, and you put the tobacco in a
  hole in his hat.</p>

  <p>Father lit it at once after breakfast, but two days after I saw Jakes
  the gardener smoking it. We thought at first that he had stolen it, and I
  went to Father, but he said that Jakes had thirteen children, and when a
  man was in trouble like that you ought to give up what you valued most to
  try to make that man happy, and that Jakes was awfully pleased when he
  gave him the pipe.</p>

  <p>You see that made it very difficult, as we had to get something that
  Father would like and Jakes too, as he still had thirteen children; and
  then I remembered that Mrs. Jakes had once looked at a woollen jumper
  that I had on, and said that it would be just the thing for her Mary Ann,
  who had a delicate chest, and Jakes would be sure to like what Mrs. Jakes
  liked, or else he wouldn't have married her. Of course a jumper wasn't
  really the sort of thing that Father could wear, but I thought he might
  wrap his foot up in it when he next had gout, and besides I shouldn't be
  wanting it much more myself, as the summer was coming on.</p>

  <p>Angela said that she thought that would do well, and she wouldn't mind
  giving Father her jumper next month if he said "Rabbits," and it would do
  for Mrs. Jakes' next little girl.</p>

  <p>So that was decided, and then we had to arrange the plan. The most
  important thing was for us to wake before Father, so that we could wake
  him and remind him before he had time to say anything else, and Angela
  remembered that Ellen, that's the housemaid, had an alarm clock, which
  she used to set at a quarter to six each morning. We waited until Ellen
  had gone downstairs and then took it and hid it in Angela's bed.</p>

  <p>Next morning the clock went off. We were both rather frightened, and
  it was very cold and the room looked funny, as the blinds hadn't been
  pulled up, but we put our dressing-gowns on. Then Angela said that she
  had heard that if you woke a person who was walking in their sleep they
  sometimes called out, so I took a pair of stockings from the basket that
  had just come back from the wash to hold over Father's mouth while we
  woke him. They were waiting to be mended and had a hole in them, but that
  didn't matter much, as I screwed them up tight, and then we went into
  Father's room. They were both asleep, and Father had his mouth open all
  ready for the stockings, which was very lucky, as I was wondering how I
  could get them in.</p>

  <p>We crept up to the bed, and I know I shivered, and I think Angela did
  too, as I was holding her hand. Then she called out "Boo" as loud as she
  could, and I stuffed the stockings into Father's mouth, and then they
  both woke up, and everything went wrong.</p>

  <p>Mother thought the house was on fire and screamed, and it made Angela
  begin to cry. I quite forgot to tell Father to say "Rabbits," and just
  pressed the stockings further into his mouth.</p>

  <p>Father struggled and made awful noises, and when he did get the
  stockings out the things he said weren't a bit like "Rabbits," and the
  only thing that he did say that I could write down here was that he
  thought he was going to be sick. The rest was dreadful.</p>

  <p>We were both sent back to bed, and that morning as a punishment we
  were not allowed into the dining-room until Father and Mother had
  finished their breakfast; and Angela, who often thinks quite clever
  things, said that we had better not do "Rabbits" again for a good long
  time. But after all it didn't matter much as the weather got a great deal
  colder, and I wore my jumper a lot, and so did Angela.</p>

<h3>HARD TIMES FOR HEROINES.</h3>

  <p>"Oh, Bertram," breathed Eunice as she glided into his arms, "if Ernest
  knew, what would he think?"</p>

  <p>At this point of my story I admit that I was held up. I myself
  couldn't help wondering how Ernest would regard the situation. He was a
  perfectly good husband and, personally, I preferred him to Bertram the
  lover. I might get unpopular with my readers, however, if they suspected
  this, so I continued:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ernest can never appreciate you as I do, dearest," Bertram whispered
  hoarsely; "he is cold, hard, indifferent&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Again I paused. If Eunice had been the really nice girl I meant her to
  be she would have asked Bertram what on earth he meant by saying such
  things about her husband, and would have told him the shortest cut to the
  front-door. In which case she might never have got into print.</p>

  <p>The fact is the poor heroine of fiction has a hard time of it
  nowadays. Someone ought to write a treatise on "How to be Happy though a
  Heroine," or uphold her cause in some way. Twenty-five years ago she
  lived in a halo of romance. Her wooers were tender, respectful and
  adoring; she was never without a chaperon. Her love-story was
  conventional and ended in wedding bells. To-day&mdash;just see how her
  position has altered. Generally she begins by being married already. Then
  her lover comes along to place her in awkward predicaments and put her to
  no end of inconvenience, very often only to make her realise that she
  prefers her husband after all. Or, on the other hand, the modern writer
  does not mind killing off, on the barest pretext, a husband who is
  perfectly sound in wind and limb and had never suffered from anything in
  his life until the lover appeared. The poor girl will tell you herself
  that it isn't natural.</p>

  <p>Then there is the compromising situation. Magazine editors clamour for
  it&mdash;in fiction, I mean. We find the heroine flung on a desert
  island, with the one man above all others in the world that she detests
  as her sole companion. It is rather rough on her, but often still more
  rough on other people, as it may necessitate drowning the entire crew and
  passengers of a large liner just in order to leave the couple alone for a
  while to get to know each other better. And not until they find that they
  care for one another after all does the rescue party arrive. It will
  cruise about, or be at anchor round the corner, for weeks and weeks, so
  that it can appear on the horizon at the moment of the first embrace.
  This situation is so popular at present that it is surprising that there
  are enough desert islands to go round.</p>

  <p>Again, the lonely bungalow episode is pretty cheerless for the
  heroine. She accepts an apparently harmless invitation to spend a
  week-end with friends in the country. When she arrives at the station
  there is no one to meet her. After a course of desert islands this ought
  to arouse her suspicions, but she never seems to benefit by experience.
  At the bungalow, reached in a hired fly and a blinding snowstorm, she
  finds the whole household away. The four other week-end guests, her host
  and hostess and their five children, the invalid aunt who resides with
  the family, the three female servants and the boot-boy who lives
  in&mdash;all have completely vanished. The only sign of life for miles is
  the hero standing on the doorstep looking bewildered and troubled, as
  well he might, for he knows that he must spend the night in a snowstorm
  to avoid compromising the heroine.</p>

  <p>And when the family return next morning and explain that they went out
  to look at the sunset, but were held up at a neighbour's by the weather,
  nobody seems to think the excuse a little thin.</p>

  <p>The heroine can never hope for a tranquil existence like other people.
  I read of one only recently who, just because she strongly objected to
  the man her parents wanted her to marry, was flung with him on an iceberg
  that had only seating capacity for two. And when the iceberg began to
  melt&mdash;writers must at times manipulate the elements&mdash;it meant
  that she must either watch the man drown or share the same seat with him.
  The rescue party held off, of course, until the harassed girl was sitting
  on his knees, and then received the pair as they slid down, announcing
  their engagement.</p>

  <p>What do I intend to do with Bertram and Eunice? I am undecided whether
  to place them in the vicinity of a volcano, which, unknown to Bertram,
  has eruptive tendencies, or to send them up in an aeroplane and break the
  propeller in mid-Atlantic just as the rescue party (including the
  husband)&mdash;What? Do I understand anything about aeroplanes? Certainly
  not; but I know everything about heroines.</p>

<h3>EVIDENCE.</h3>

  <p>"What's all this I hear about the Abbey?" said my friend Truscott when
  I met him yesterday.</p>

  <p>Truscott has just returned from New Zealand and is for the moment a
  little behind the times. But he can pick up the threads as quickly as
  most men.</p>

  <p>"It's in a bad way," I told him. "All kinds of defects in the fabric,
  and there's a public fund to make it sound again. You ought to
  subscribe."</p>

  <p>"It may be in disrepair," he replied, "but it isn't going to fall down
  just yet. I know; I went to see it this morning."</p>

  <p>"But how do you know?" I asked. "You may guess; you can't know."</p>

  <p>"I know," he said, "because I was told. A little bird told me, and
  there's no authority half so good. Do you remember a few years ago a
  terrific storm that blew down half the elms in Kensington Gardens?"</p>

  <p>I remembered. I had reason; for the trunks and branches were all over
  the road and my omnibus from Church Street to Piccadilly Circus had to
  make wide detours.</p>

  <p>"Well," Truscott continued, "someone wrote to the papers to say that
  two or three days before the storm all the rooks left the trees and did
  not return. They knew what was coming. Birds do know, you know, and
  that's why I feel no immediate anxiety about the Abbey."</p>

  <p>"Explain," I said.</p>

  <p>"Well," he continued, "when I was there this morning I watched a
  sparrow popping in and out of a nest built in a niche in the stonework
  over the north door."</p>

<h2>THOUGHTS ON "THE TIMES."</h2>

<p class="center">(<font class="sc">From a Train.</font>)</p>

  <p>Really the news is very bad this morning. On the front page there are
  two Foreign crises and a Home one. On the next page there is one Grave
  Warning and two probable strikes. On every other page there is either a
  political murder or a new war. It is awful ...</p>

  <p>Yet somehow I don't feel depressed. I rather feel like giggling. An
  empty smoker in the Cornish express&mdash;<i>empty</i> except for me!
  Extraordinary! And all my luggage in the right van, labelled for Helston,
  and not for Hull or Harwich or Hastings. That porter was a splendid
  fellow, so respectful, so keen on his work&mdash;no Bolshevism about
  <i>him</i>. I gave him a shilling. I gave the taxi-man a shilling too.
  That guard is a pleasant fellow also; I shall give him two shillings,
  perhaps half-a-crown. Yet I see that the railways are seething with
  unrest.</p>

  <p>I have just read <i>The Times'</i> leader. Everything seems to be
  coming undone ... Persia, Mesopotamia, Egypt, India. This Bolshevist
  business ... dreadful. The guard has got me a ticket for the Second
  Luncheon. A capital fellow. I gave him three shillings. Absurd. I have no
  more shillings now. I am overdrawn. There is a financial crisis. But
  that, of course, is general. I see that Mr. Iselbaum anticipates a
  general smash this winter. A terrible winter it is going to be ... no
  coal, no food ... We ought to be in by five, in time for a fat late tea
  ... Cornish cream ... jam. Gwen will be at the station, with the
  children, all in blue ... or pink perhaps. How jolly the country looks!
  Superficial, of course; the harvest's ruined; no wheat, no fruit. And
  unemployment will be very bad. And the more people there are unemployed
  the more people will strike ... Sounds funny, that; but true ... Hope
  they've given us the usual table in the coffee-room, that jolly
  window-table in the corner, where one can look across the bay to the
  cliffs and the corn-fields and the hills ... Only there's no corn, I
  suppose, this year ... And one has a good view of the rest of the room
  there ... can study the new arrivals at dinner, instead of having to wait
  till afterwards. Dinner is much the best time to study them; you can see
  at once how they eat. And it is so much easier to decide which is the
  sister and which the <i>fiancée</i> of the young man when they are all
  stationary at a table. When you only see them rushing about passages in
  ones it takes days.</p>

  <p>All the usual families will be there, I suppose&mdash;the Bradleys and
  the Clinks, old Mrs. Puntage and the kids&mdash;if they can afford it
  this year ... Very likely they can't. I can't, certainly. But I'm
  going.</p>

  <p>"Not since the fateful week-end of August, 1914, when the destinies of
  Europe were decided in a few hours, have issues of such gravity engaged
  the attention of the British race...." Dreadful. I shall get some tennis
  tomorrow. I shan't be called. I shall get up when the sun is on my face
  and not before. I shall dress very, very slowly, looking at the sea and
  the sands and the sun, not rushing, not shaving properly, not thinking,
  not washing a great deal, just sort of falling into an old coat and some
  grey flannels.... Then I shall just sort of fall downstairs&mdash;about
  half-past nine, and give the old barometer a bang. Then breakfast, very
  deliberate, but cheerful, because the glass went up when I banged
  it&mdash;it always goes up at that hotel ... like the cost of living. Up
  another five points to-day, I see. Bread's going to be
  one-and-threepence. But of course there won't <i>be</i> any bread this
  winter, so the price doesn't much matter. But what about coal? and milk?
  and meat? "Several new sets of wage claims are due for decision within
  the next few weeks, and it is possible that two of them at least may not
  be determined without a cessation of work." More strikes ... But not for
  a week or two. To-morrow there won't be any papers at breakfast; there
  won't be any letters. I shan't catch the 9.5. After breakfast I shall
  smoke on the cliff&mdash;then some tennis. Most of the balls will go over
  the cliff, but when they have all gone one just slips down and bathes,
  and picks them up on the way. Undress on the rocks&mdash;no machines, no
  tents. Jolly bathing. Mixed, of course. This Tonbridge councillor is on
  about that again, I see. He ought to come to Mullion. Mixed bathing
  depends entirely on the mixture. He doesn't realise that. Of course, if
  he <i>will</i> bathe at Tonbridge ...</p>

  <p>"In diplomatic circles no one is attempting to conceal that the
  situation is extremely grave." Now which situation is that? That must be
  one of these world-plots. Don't really see how civilisation can carry on
  more than a week or two now. Lucky I only took a single, perhaps. It was
  only two pounds, but I hadn't enough for a return. Never shall have
  enough, probably&mdash;but no matter. If the world is coming to an end,
  might as well be in a good part of it at the time. And it would be
  sickening to be snuffed out with an unused return-ticket in one's
  pocket.</p>

  <p>On the sands after lunch&mdash;build a few castles and dams and things
  for the children&mdash;at least, not altogether for the children, not so
  much as they think, anyhow. Tea at the farm, with plenty of cream,
  possibly an egg ... No eggs this winter, I see; some question of
  non-unionists. Then a little golf before dinner&mdash;and perhaps a
  little dancing afterwards. Coffee, anyhow ...</p>

  <p>Then <i>The Times</i> arrives, all wrapped up, just as one is
  explaining about the seventh hole. It is all stiff and crinkly, and one
  spends a long time rearranging it, flattening out the folds ...</p>

  <p>And one never reads it. That's the best of all.</p>

<h3>PRONE.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>To the Editor of "Punch."</i></p>

  <p><font class="sc">Sir</font>,&mdash;I am an architect (of forty-three
  years' standing) and I like to keep <i>au courant</i> with everything in
  the world of building (or of being about to build). Consequently anything
  new in constructional material interests me, and in this connection I
  would like to ask you what is or what are Prone? I have only seen it (or
  them) mentioned once, and from the context I gather that the word "prone"
  stands for the plural of "prone" (as "grouse" is the plural of "grouse,"
  and as "house" might well stand for the plural of "house" nowadays,
  considering the shortage of dwellings), and that it (or they) is (or are)
  used either as a floor covering or otherwise in connection with working
  on the floor or ground.</p>

  <p>My reason for so thinking is contained in the following interesting
  item, culled from a well-known daily newspaper:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>"There is in London one man at least who works hard every day and has
  to lay prone to do it.</p>

  <p>He may be seen daily in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey re-cutting
  the names on the flagged gravestones which have been worn by countless
  pilgrims' feet. He has picked out many illustrious names, and others are
  to follow."</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>The sex and species of this hard-worker preclude the notion of any
  oviparous act, and I take it that one "lays prone" as one lays a mat or
  strip of carpet, for the purpose of facilitating labour that is done on
  the knees or stomach. If I am right I should like to get my builder to
  order some for his workmen absolutely at once.</p>

  <p>Anything which would help to defeat the Trade Unions in their fight
  against speeding-up would be a blessing, especially to the architectural
  world, so perhaps you will be good enough to enlighten me on the nature
  of Prone, and where obtainable.</p>

<h2>GEORGE, JANE AND LENIN.</h2>

  <p>Now that Soviet rule in England is apparently so imminent it seems to
  me that we ought to consider a little more closely the application of its
  practical machinery. The morning papers reach this village at three
  o'clock in the afternoon, so that nobody is in to read them, and when one
  comes back in the evening one is generally too lazy, but a couple of
  rather startling sentences about the coming Communist <i>régime</i> have
  recently caught my eye.</p>

  <p>"The people of England, like the people of Russia," runs the first,
  "will soon be working under the lash." And the second, so far as I
  remember, says, "Our rations will no doubt be reduced to half a herring
  and some boiled bird-seed, which is all the unhappy Russians are getting
  to eat."</p>

  <p>Before these changes fall suddenly upon us I think we should ponder a
  little on the way in which they will affect our urban and agricultural
  life.</p>

  <p>Take the House of Commons. A very large and symbolic knout might
  occupy the position of the present mace, and from time to time the <font
  class="sc">Speaker</font> could take it up and crack it. As this needs a
  certain amount of practice it will be necessary to select a fairly horsey
  man as Speaker, and the Whips, who will follow the same procedure, should
  also be skilled practitioners. I see no difficulty in applying the same
  method to commercial and factory life in general, still less to the
  packing of the Underground Railway and the loading of motor-omnibuses and
  trams.</p>

  <p>It is rather when we come to scattered rural communities that the
  system seems likely to break down. Take the case of George Harrison in
  this village. When I first met George Harrison, and he said that he
  thought the weather was lifting, he was carrying a basket of red plums
  which he offered to sell me for an old song. On subsequent occasions I
  met him&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Driving cows. (At least I suppose he was driving them; he was
  sitting sideways on a large horse doing nothing in particular, and some
  of the cows were going into one field and some into another, and a dog
  was biting their tails indiscriminately.)</p>

  <p>2. Clearing muck and weeds out of the stream.</p>

  <p>3. Setting a springe for rabbits.</p>

  <p>4. Delivering letters, because the postman doesn't like walking up the
  hill.</p>

  <p>Now I maintain that there would be insuperable difficulties in making
  George carry out all these various activities under the lash. Anyone, I
  suppose, under a properly constituted Soviet <i>régime</i> might be
  detailed as George Harrison's lasher, Mr. <font
  class="sc">Smillie</font>, Mr. <font class="sc">G.K. Chesterton</font>,
  Lord <font class="sc">Curzon</font>, Mr. <font class="sc">Clynes</font>
  or the Duke of <font class="sc">Northumberland</font>. Can you imagine
  Mr. <font class="sc">Chesterton</font> walking about on guard duty in a
  rabbit warren while George Harrison set springes in accordance with the
  principles laid down by the Third Internationale for rabbit-snaring? or
  the Duke of <font class="sc">Northumberland</font> standing in gum-boots
  in the middle of a stream and flicking George Harrison about the trousers
  if he didn't rake out old tin cans at forty to the minute as laid down by
  the Moscow Code? Now I ask you.</p>

  <p>And then there is this half a herring and boiled bird-seed
  arrangement. George Harrison has a sister of eighteen who kindly comes in
  to do cooking and housework for us every day. She thinks <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span> us
  frightfully queer, and if we bought some herrings and bird-seed and asked
  her to cook them for us I have no doubt she would oblige, but, though she
  doesn't much care what we eat, there are a lot of things she doesn't eat
  herself, and fish is one of them. Porridge, which, I suppose, is a kind
  of bird-seed, is another.</p>

  <p>Not that Jane calls it eating, by the way. She calls it "touching,"
  and there are any number of things that she doesn't fancy touching. She
  will touch enormous platefuls of bacon or sausages or almost any
  derivative of the domestic pig, and the same applies to puddings and
  cake. But beef and mutton she does not touch, nor margarine, and we have
  to be almost as careful that Jane Harrison has plenty of the right things
  to touch as about the whole of the rest of the family.</p>

  <p>Now here again I think it would be quite possible to induce the people
  of England in our large industrial centres to ration themselves on boiled
  herring and bird-seed. We should not use those names, of course. The
  advertisements on the hoardings would say:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><font class="sc">The Bountiful Harvest of the Sea brought to the Breakfast Table</font></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>or</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><font class="sc">What Makes The Skylark so Happy?</font></p>
      <p><font class="sc">Try Harraby's Hemp. A Song in Every Spoonful.</font></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But propaganda of that sort would have no effect on Jane. She would
  simply say that she never cared to touch herrings and that she did not
  fancy hemp-seed.</p>

  <p>When I consider the cases of George and Jane I am bound to believe
  either that the Russian moujiks (if this is still the right word) are
  more docile and tractable than ours, or else that the Soviet
  <i>régime</i> will need a great deal of adaptation before it can be
  extended to our English villages. Or, of course, it may be possible that
  some of the minuter details of <font class="sc">M. Lenin's</font>
  administration have not been fully revealed to me. I shall find out about
  this no doubt when I return to London. In the meantime I am banking on
  George and Jane, whatever the <font class="sc">Council of Action</font>
  may do.</p>

<h2>LUCERNE.</h2>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>O, every dog must have its day</p>
      <p class="i2">And ev'ry town its turn;</p>
      <p>For fair is fair ... and, anyway,</p>
      <p class="i2">Let's talk about Lucerne.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Lucerne is in Switzerland, and I am in Lucerne. The moment I heard
  that Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd George</font> was coming to Lucerne I
  felt that a new importance was added to Switzerland, to Lucerne, to me
  and, if I may say so, to Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd George</font>. But I
  felt that, if I didn't do something about it, Lucerne and Mr. <font
  class="sc">Lloyd George</font> would get away with all the credit and my
  part in the affair would be overlooked.</p>

  <p>The question arose as to what to call that "something"? After a great
  deal of thought I decided to try you with a short and simple "Lucerne,"
  one of my reasons being that, if you get down to the hard facts, there is
  no such place.</p>

  <p>Try (as the G.P.O. suggests to disappointed envelopes)&mdash;try</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><font class="sc">Luzern</font>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now don't let us have any argument about it, please. It makes no
  difference how long you have called the place "Lucerne" or how many of
  you there are. It is no good saying that English people and French people
  call it "Lucerne" and as victors the Entente have the right to impose
  their wishes; and it is no good quoting authorities at me. Luzern calls
  itself Luzern, and, to satisfy myself that it is not mistaken on the
  point, I have obtained complete corroboration from the <i>Amtliches
  Schweizerisches Kursbuch</i>, an authority whose very name is enough to
  make your <i>Bradshaw</i> look silly and shut up.</p>

  <p>The avowed object of the <font class="sc">Premier</font> is to get
  away from people and politics and to have at last a little uninterrupted
  holiday. Probably he counts on the difficulty of getting at him there,
  having regard to that terrible bit of the journey Bern&mdash;Luzern,
  which covers sixty miles, takes three hours and involves twenty-four
  stops, even if you take the mid-day express. There is a train in the
  afternoon (its number is 5666, and I warn you against it) which takes
  four hours, though it only stops twenty-four times also. The sinister
  fact is that all the trains on this route stop as often as they can,
  which I attribute to that general wave of idleness which is to-day
  spreading over Europe. But number 5666 is worse than others; or else it
  is getting old and tired. I notice that among the trains doing the return
  journey there is no number 5666; I suppose it has just as much as it can
  do to get there and that it never does return.</p>

  <p>The <font class="sc">Premier</font> was not far out to count on this
  protective element, and it is still the fact that, if you approach Luzern
  carelessly, it is ninety-nine to one that you will spend the best years
  of your young life on that particular stretch of railway. But nowadays
  there is a back way round, by Basel. Be quite firm in asking for your
  ticket. If the ticket man says, "You mean Bâle?" or, "You mean Basle?"
  say, "No, I don't. I mean Basel." You have me and my friend, <i>Amtliches
  Schweizerisches Kursbuch</i>, behind you. Stick firmly to your point, and
  by approaching Luzern from the North you will approach it by a real
  express which only takes two hours to do its sixty miles and hardly stops
  at all to take breath. So that finishes with Bern, as to the spelling of
  which, though you would personally like to see some more "e's," you now
  repose confidence in me. Would you like me to quote my authority?... All
  right; I won't say it again if it frightens the children.</p>

  <p>In the old days of Peace, Luzern was full of honeymoon couples, and,
  when Peace and honeymoons and all that sort of nonsense were put a stop
  to, it became full of German interned prisoners of war. It boasts many
  first-class hotels. One of them is patronised by the Greek ex-Royal
  Family. A little unfortunate; but still you cannot expect to come and
  enjoy yourself in Switzerland without the risk of running <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span> into
  an ex-Royal Family every corner you go round, and, what is more, a Royal
  Family that wouldn't be ex- if it wasn't for you. It is a very good
  hotel, and I recommend it for anyone who proposes just to pop over
  here.</p>

  <p>Get hold of L.G. while he is not busy and explain to him how
  thoroughly misguided all his policies are, especially as to the Near
  East. My idea is to group, according to subject and side, all those who
  intend to get hold of the <font class="sc">Premier</font>, while he is
  alone, and to have a quiet chat with him. I have my eye on a large hangar
  on the other side of the Lake, which was built to house a dirigible and
  ought to hold the bulk of those who want a word about Ireland, a place
  they could put right in five minutes if it was left to them. Deputations
  which have some idea of declaring strikes, general strikes and
  international strikes, if matters are not arranged to their liking, will
  be received between the hours of ten and twelve, and two and four, at the
  Kursaal. Saturday afternoons and Sundays will be reserved for quiet
  walks. I am mapping out some interesting routes, marking with a red dot
  the spots where the <font class="sc">Premier</font> is likely to stop and
  admire the view, and where you can approach him quietly from behind and
  involve him in an argument about Russia before he has time to get
  away.</p>

  <p>Image a <font class="sc">Premier</font> arrived at the end of all the
  beautiful sights to be seen locally, inured to all the magnificent
  scenery around him, and no longer attracted by the novelty of life
  abroad, longing, it may be, for just one touch of home. Then is the
  moment for the little surprise I am keeping for him up my sleeve. "Come
  along to a place close by," I shall say to him, for I see myself with the
  whole business well in my hands now; "come along to a village I know,
  whose very name will make you feel at home."</p>

  <p>Just outside Luzern we stop at Meggen, but it's not that. Kussnacht
  gets us well abroad again, and there is nothing particularly homely about
  Immensee, Arth-Goldau, Steinen, Schwyz or Brunnen. In fact I can see my
  <font class="sc">Premier</font> getting suspicious and wondering what new
  political move this may be, when suddenly there will burst upon his
  astonished gaze&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><font class="sc">Fluellen.</font></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Let us leave him there, alone with his emotions, into which it would
  be impertinent to probe. I may tell you quietly apart that there is a
  difference of opinion between me and <i>Amtliches Schweizerisches
  Kursbuch</i> about this name. He wants to ration the l's, but, having
  been there and heard the name pronounced, I have refused to be taught how
  to spell a good Welsh name by a darned foreigner. If we are going to have
  any nonsense about it I have said that I shall stand out for the proper,
  full and uncorrupt spelling: <font class="sc">Fllewellyn</font>.</p>

<h2>"TO HIM THAT HATH ..."</h2>

  <p>It was Butterington who first put me up to the idea. I asked him a
  simple question about the habits of the Sigalion Boa, a certain worm in
  whose ways I was taking an interest at the time, and he at once replied
  that he himself was not in the fur line.</p>

  <p>"Whenever," he went on, "I require information on any subject I apply
  to my bank. Why don't you do the same?"</p>

  <p>This opened up an entirely new prospect. To me my bank was an
  institution which kept my accounts, issued money and, on occasion, lent
  it. It never entered my head that it was also ready to perform the
  functions of an inquiry office and information bureau.</p>

  <p>Previous communications from me had always begun, "Sir, with reference
  to my overdraft"&mdash;you know the sort of thing one generally writes to
  banks; expostulating, tactful, temporising letters.</p>

  <p>This time however I addressed them in different vein. Rejecting all
  mention of overdrafts as being in doubtful taste, I wrote:&mdash;</p>

  <p><font class="sc">Sir</font>,&mdash;I shall be greatly obliged if you
  will kindly inform me, at your early convenience:</p>

  <p>(1) Whether it is a fact that the African rhinoceros has no hair on
  the hind legs?</p>

  <p>(2) Whether, in the case of my backing Pegasus in the first race, 'any
  to come' on Short Time in the fourth, and Short Time not starting, I am
  entitled to my winnings over Pegasus?</p>

  <p>(3) Whether, after perusing seventeen favourable reports from mining
  engineers and eighty-seven enthusiastic directors' speeches, I am
  justified in assuming that gold actually does exist in the Bonanzadorado
  mine?</p>

<p class="center">Yours faithfully,<br />
<font class="sc">Thesiger Cholmondeley Beauchamp.</font></p>

  <p>After some delay they answered as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p><font class="sc">Sir</font>,&mdash;We have much pleasure in replying
  to the queries contained in your favour, of the 27th ult.:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>(1) Yes; (2) Yes; (3) No.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Assuring you always of our best endeavours in your service,</p>

<p class="center">We remain, Yours faithfully,<br />
<i>per pro</i> The Cosmopolitan Bkg. Corpn.<br />
<font class="sc">C.O. Shine.</font></p>

  <p>So far so good. The Bank's manner left nothing to be desired, and its
  replies were certainly to the point. I began to think of Mr. C.O. Shine
  as my personal friend and speculated as to whether his first name were
  Claude or Clarence.</p>

  <p>During the following week, whenever I became curious on any subject, I
  made notes of fresh queries to propound. After accumulating a sufficient
  number I again wrote to the Bank. I forget the exact points upon which I
  required information; one of them, I fancy, was the conjectured geologic
  age of the Reichardtite strata. Anyhow I got no answer to any of

  <p><font class="sc">Sir</font>,&mdash;We regret to announce that, owing

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center">"<font class="sc">His Lady Friends.</font>"</p>

  <p>The humours of the average farce are so elemental that in the matter
  of its setting there is small need to worry about geographical or
  ethnical considerations. Of course, if its <i>locale</i> is French you
  may have to modify its freedom of thought and speech, but with a very
  little accommodation to national proprieties you can either transplant
  the setting of your play or you can leave it where it was and make use of
  the convention that for stage purposes all Frenchmen have a perfect
  command of our tongue and idiom. But to take a frankly English novel by
  an English writer, adapt it, as Messrs. <font class="sc">Nyitray</font>
  and <font class="sc">Mandel</font> have done, for the American stage with
  an American setting, and then bring it over here and produce it with only
  one or two actors in the whole cast to illustrate the purity of the
  American accent, is perhaps to presume rather too much on our generous
  lack of intelligence.</p>

  <p>However we have got Mr. <font class="sc">Charles Hawtrey</font> back
  again and that is what really matters. As a philanderer protesting
  innocence in the face of damnatory facts we know him well enough; but
  here we have him innocent and ingenuous as an angel, yet hard put to it
  to convince anyone but himself of his guilelessness. A millionaire
  (dollars) with a wife of economic disposition, who declines to spend his
  money for him, he feels drawn to a course of knight-errantry and rides
  abroad in search of damsels in pecuniary distress, with the avowed object
  of "spreading a little sunshine."</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/152.png"><img width="100%" src="images/152.png"
      alt="I want to spread a little sunshine." /></a>
    <p class="center">"I want to spread a little sunshine."</p>

    <div class="i16">
    <p><i>James Smith</i> ... Mr. <font class="sc">Charles
    Hawtrey.</font></p>

    <p><i>Eva Johns</i> ... Miss <font class="sc">Joan Barry.</font></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This quest, as you will easily understand, was not a very difficult
  one for a man prepared to be imposed upon by just any adventuress, and in
  the neighbourhood of his various business-branches, San Francisco,
  Washington, Boston, he soon found a ready channel for the employment of
  his superfluous wealth. The natural affection, however, which his
  generosity inspired was not utilised by him, and you must try to believe
  that, in spite of the most sinister appearances, he remained a faithful
  husband.</p>

  <p>With the methods by which he appeased his wife's suspicions I will not
  trouble you, partly because I could not follow them myself, owing to the
  obscurity of the plot at its most critical moment. Enough that all ends
  well with her firmly-expressed resolution that in the future she will
  herself do all the necessary squandering.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Charles Hawtrey</font> as <i>James Smith</i> was
  irresistible in most of the old ways and a few new ones. The play would
  have gone poorly without him, in spite of the piquancy of Miss <font
  class="sc">Joan Barry</font> as a flapper, the fourth and final recipient
  of his chaste bounty. Miss <font class="sc">Jessie Bateman</font> as
  <i>Mrs. James Smith</i> had no chance till just at the end with the
  turning of the worm. To the part of <i>Lucille Early</i>&mdash;the
  <i>Earlys</i>, as a couple, were designed to contrast with the
  <i>Smiths</i>, the wife in this case spending the money which the husband
  hadn't got&mdash;Miss <font class="sc">Athene Seyler</font>, who was
  meant for better things, gave a certain distinction, but perhaps
  "pressed" a little too much. Mr. <font class="sc">James Carew</font>, who
  played <i>Edward Early</i>, was conspicuous as the sole male
  representative of the American language in this American play. The
  fleeting visions that we had of Miss <font class="sc">Mona
  Harrison</font> as a refractory and venal cook excited general approval.
  The three <i>protegées</i> of <i>James Smith</i> were only faintly
  distinguishable in their rather crude banality.</p>

  <p>The fun of the farce differed from that of most farces in depending
  less upon situations than upon dialogue. The First Act, with the
  situations still to come, was the best. I have not had the good fortune
  to read Miss <font class="sc">Edgington's</font> novel, but one might be
  permitted to assume, from the excellence of much of the wit, that,
  whatever the play may in other respects have lacked of subtlety or
  refinement, such defect was no fault of hers. What Mr. <font
  class="sc">Charles Hawtrey</font> himself thought of it all I cannot say,
  but the play did not begin to compare, either for irony or singleness of
  motive, with the last two in which he figured, <i>The Naughty Wife</i>
  and <i>Home and Beauty.</i> He clearly enjoyed his own part, but it was
  rather noticeable that in his brief speech at the fall of the curtain he
  confined himself to a personal acknowledgment of the public's sympathy
  with him in his illness and their loyalty throughout his career, and made
  no reference to the play or its authors.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>Those who appreciate the short story of quality will be pleasantly
  stirred by the announcement of <i>Island Tales</i> (<font
  class="sc">Mills and Boon</font>), a posthumous volume containing what is
  probably the last writing of the late <font class="sc">Jack
  London</font>. I can say at once that these seven stories show his art in
  one aspect of its best. Not here the <font class="sc">London</font>, whom
  some of us might prefer, of the strenuous adventure-tale, with whom there
  was no respite till, at the end of anything up to a hundred
  sinew-cracking pages, we won through to the appointed end. That South Sea
  atmosphere, so insidiously appealing to the literary temperament (from
  <font class="sc">Stevenson</font> to <font class="sc">Stacpoole</font>
  you can see it at work) has steeped these tales in the lotus-leisure of
  perpetual afternoon, so that the action of them tends to become overlaid
  by slow reflective talk, old memories and the sense of ancient things.
  Most notable is this in the first, where the actual romance, quick, human
  and haunting, does not so much as show its face till after forty pages of
  old-time local colour. Perhaps of all the seven I myself would prefer the
  last&mdash;"The Kanaka Surf," a slight intrigue, but a perfect epic of
  such bathing as, I suppose, can be understood nowhere but on these
  enchanted coasts. To read it is to realise what a loss we suffer in one
  who could put such jewelled loveliness on to the printed page&mdash;and
  what another loss in not seeing the original for ourselves. I suppose no
  tribute to the power of genius could be more eloquent.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>After the German Revolution of 1918, <font class="sc">Karl
  Kautsky</font>, a prominent Socialist, was appointed by the new
  Government to examine and edit the documents in the Berlin Foreign Office
  relating to the outbreak of the War. His work was completed in time for
  the Peace Conference and would, he believes, if published at that time,
  have convinced the Allies that the new German Government ought not to be
  made responsible for the sins of the old one. But it would also have
  shown that the old Government was the main instigator of the War, and
  that the German people, having danced to the tune, even if they did not
  call for it, deserved to pay the piper. For that reason, perhaps, the
  German Government withheld Herr <font class="sc">Kautsky's</font>
  revelations. Now he has published them on his own account, under the
  title, <i>The Guilt of William Hohenzollern</i> (<font
  class="sc">Skeffington</font>). A more damning indictment has never been
  drawn. From the moment of the <font class="sc">Archduke's</font>
  assassination the <font class="sc">Kaiser</font> and his advisers
  determined to make it the pretext for destroying Serbia, and crushing
  Russia and France if they dared to interfere. <font
  class="sc">Bismarck</font> once said that "never are so many lies told as
  before a war, during an election and after a shoot." His own manipulation
  of the Ems telegram was venial compared to the manner in which the German
  diplomatists, egged on by their ruler&mdash;whose <i>marginalia</i> on
  the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg
  160]</span> despatches furnish the most amusing reading in the
  volume&mdash;used all the arts of chicanery to deceive Europe as to their
  real intentions and to defeat the efforts of England&mdash;on whose
  neutrality they confidently counted&mdash;to secure a peaceful
  settlement. Though primarily addressed to the German proletariat, Herr
  <font class="sc">Kautsky's</font> book has its value for all of
  us&mdash;"lest we forget."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>On page 103 of <i>The White Hen</i> (<font class="sc">Mills and
  Boon</font>) we read that the <i>Duke</i> laughed softly. "'It is just
  like a romance,' he sighed happily;" which was precisely where, without
  intending it, the <i>Duke</i> placed his ducal finger upon the weak spot
  in the whole business. Because if ever a story was "like a romance," and
  like nothing else on earth, and filled with characters each and all
  pledged to preserve its unreality at all costs, here is that tale. The
  plot, of which there is a generous allowance, turns chiefly upon the
  problem, when is a white hen less a hen than a jewel casket? Answer, when
  she has swallowed, and is erroneously thought to have retained, a famous
  diamond, upon which an impoverished but noble (see above) French family
  had depended for the <i>dot</i> that should enable their daughter to wed
  a plutocratic but otherwise detestable suitor. I take it you will hardly
  need telling that this is the moment chosen by Romance, under the expert
  guidance of Miss <font class="sc">Phyllis Campbell</font>, to bring along
  an even more wealthy young American, mistaken (of course) for his own
  chauffeur and working such havoc upon the heart of the heroine that, when
  the latter accidentally recovered the diamond from its feathered
  <i>cache</i>, she very sensibly decided to say nothing about it.
  Whereupon, because the other characters, especially an unpleasant
  Duchess, were unaware that, as the shop announcements say, "Poultry was
  Down Again," much profitable confusion resulted, though nothing to impugn
  the justice of the ducal verdict quoted above. So that, if your taste
  jumps with that of his Grace, you also can "sigh happily;" otherwise you
  will perhaps omit the adverb&mdash;and select a story less exclusively
  romantic.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>There is a spirit of Yorkshire and a spirit, I suppose, characteristic
  of Suburbia, and on the outskirts of certain large manufacturing towns
  there must exist a formidable blending of these two. To express the
  double flavour of this essence requires, I should say, a subtler and more
  elaborate method than Mr. <font class="sc">W. Riley</font> has attempted
  to use in <i>A Yorkshire Suburb</i> (<font class="sc">Jenkins</font>). He
  has imagined for the purpose of these sketches an architect,
  <i>Murgatroyd</i>, who in planning most of the houses in the locality has
  attempted to express in brick and stone the characters of their several
  occupants. This is a device which becomes rather monotonous as the book
  proceeds, besides imposing a series of strains which neither architecture
  nor credulity can easily bear. Since these are rather superior
  suburbanites, dialect is for the most part absent, and it is hard to feel
  that they are very different people from those who live about the borders
  of Manchester or London; a character like <i>Mrs. Flitch</i>, for
  instance, who is angelic to behold but a spiteful gossip at heart, is,
  alas! to be found anywhere. And where the dialect does crop out it does
  not seem to be dependent on suburban soil for its raciness. I don't doubt
  the accuracy of Mr. <font class="sc">Riley's</font> Yorkshiremanship, but
  I do think he has under-estimated the difficulty of localising the
  peculiar genius of villadom.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Though billed by her publisher as a merciless analyst, Mrs. <font
  class="sc">Mordaunt</font> is really (if you want to fling this kind of
  title about) an eclectic synthetist or synthetic symbolist. Her wicked
  people are prodigiously wicked, wickedness personified, in fact; her good
  folk are noble-hearted without stint or measure. I don't personally think
  that anybody could be quite so completely and gratuitously evil as
  good-looking <i>Charles Hoyland</i> in <i>The Little Soul</i> (<font
  class="sc">Hutchinson</font>); or, being so, could possibly be
  recommended, still less engaged, as tutor to a sensitive youth; or, being
  so engaged, tolerated for two days. He certainly could not hold down his
  job long enough to corrupt his pupil, <i>Anthony Clayton</i>, by
  exchanging souls with him under the nose of mad but perceptive <i>Mrs.
  Clayton</i> and sane sister <i>Diana</i>. This conspicuously chaste
  <i>Diana</i> is an attractive person, and so is the recklessly charitable
  <i>Dr. McCabe</i>, her appropriate mate, who first had to fly the country
  through helping a chorus-girl out of a difficulty and then (more or less)
  won the War by revolutionising bacteriology or something like that.
  However, Mrs. <font class="sc">Mordaunt</font> interests because she is
  so palpably interested herself.</p>

  <p>The scenes of <i>Lure of Contraband</i> (<font
  class="sc">Jarrolds</font>) are laid in the Devonshire of some hundred
  years ago. It is, as its title suggests, a tale of smuggling, and it
  contains an account of a hand-to-hand fight between the hero and the
  villain which I advise all members of the National Sporting Club to read.
  They may be shocked by the tactics of the villain, but at the same time

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
